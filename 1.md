# Stable Matching

## Input: n boys (A B C) & n girls (X Y Z)

## Preference

+ A: X Y Z
+ B: Y X Z
+ C: X Y Z

+ X: B A C
+ Y: A B C
+ Z: A B C

## Goal: find a stable matching (not exist unstable pair)

Given a matching, we say pair (a, b) is unstable if a prefers b to his/her current partner and b prefers a to his/her current partner.

## propose-and-reject algorithm

```
while (there is somebody unengaged)
    A = arbitrary single boy
    X = first girl A hasn't proposal yet
    if X is single
        match (A, X)
    else if B is better than A (B as X's current bf)
        do nothing
    else
        reject B and match (A, X)
```

## Observation: for a girl if she gets engaged, she will be engaged from then on her bf only improved

## Lemma: upon termination, everyone is engaged

## Lemma: there is no unstable pair in the solution

Proof by contradiction: suppose (A, X) is unstable, then A prefers X to his current partner Y, X prefers A to her current partner B.

X must reject A before A find current gf Y, then X must prefer B, contradict to the assumption.

## "Random" instance: every boy's list is random permutation of girls

random time/#iteration of G-S algorithm

$$
    E[\text{\#iteration}] = \sum_{I\text{: all possible instances}} \operatorname{Pr}[I]\cdot T[I] \le O(n \log n)
$$

$$
    T[I] = \text{running time on instance }I
$$

G-S: a boy proposes to a random girl he hasn't proposed yet

G-S': same as G-S, but may repeat(no side effect)

Intuitively G-S' is slower than G-S.

G-S' is equivalent to "bin-balls"(Coupon Collector problem), given $n$ empty bins and balls.

$$
\operatorname{E} [\text{\#balls we need s.t. all bins are not empty}] \le O(n\log n)
$$

a ball <-------> boy

a bin <-------> girl

## DFS & BFS

DFS(G): G(V, E): directed graph
V: set of vertices, E: set of edges

```
for each vertex u in G
    u.color = white(unexplored)
time = 0
for each u in V
    if u.color == white
        DFS-Visit(u)
```

```
DFS-Visit(u)
    time++
    u.d = time(discovery time)
    u.color = gray(exploring the node)
    for each neighbor v of u
        if v.color == white
            DFS-Visit(v)
    u.color = black(finished)
    time++
    u.f = time(finish time)
```

parenthesis theorem:

for any two vertices u, v, exactly one of the following three conditions holds:

1. [u.d, u.f] and [v.d, v.f] are entirely disjoint
2. [u.d, u.f] is entirely contained within [v.d, v.f]
3. [v.d, v.f] is entirely contained within [u.d, u.f]

white-path theorem:

in a DFS forest of a graph G, vertex v is a descendant of vertex u if and only if at the time u.d is discovered, there is a path from u to v consisting entirely of white vertices.
